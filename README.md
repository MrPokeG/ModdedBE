# ModdedBE
A professional but **FREE** NMod Launcher for Minecraft Bedrock Editions (Android ONLY).  
**ModdedBE is mostly completed now. If you found bugs, please report to us (in the issues page), then we will fix them.**  
**Pull requests will be much more welcomed than issues. The developers could not manage to fix every issues in time, and they may not want to do it.**

This ModdedBE project is a completely new NMod launcher compared to the last one "ModdedPE".It is designed to support multi-versions of Minecraft, and there're possibilities for it to become a cross-platform Minecraft Launcher.  
**ATTENTION:** Former NMods for ModdedPE could not be loaded with ModdedBE.

## Run the code
 Download Android Studio, android sdk and android ndk.  
 Build,install and run the app.  
 **ATTENTION:** Please install Mincraft first.Running on physical devices is recommended, as there are quite a lot opengl problems on android virtual devices on which you cannot open Minecraft even though you don't use ModdedBE.
